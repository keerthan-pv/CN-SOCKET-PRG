This project includes two servers: a Secure Proxy Server and a Plain 
Server. The Secure Proxy Server uses SSL to protect communication and 
checks if the client provides the correct password (token) before 
allowing access. If the client is authorized, they can send a message, 
and the server replies back. The Plain Server, on the other hand, runs 
without security and simply receives and responds to messages. The 
client program can connect to either server based on a setting, allowing 
users to test both secure and non-secure communication.
