# Proxy Firewall - Computer Networks Project

- **Keerthan P.V** – PES2UG23CS272  

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of two types of servers:  

### 🔒 Secure Proxy Server
- Utilizes **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** to encrypt communication.
- Requires clients to authenticate using a **password token**.
- Once authorized, the client can send a message, and the server responds.

### 🌐 Plain Server
- Operates **without any security** layer.
- Accepts client messages and replies back, without authentication or encryption.

## 💡 Key Features
- Demonstrates the contrast between **secure** and **non-secure** server communications.
- Provides a **client program** that can connect to either server via a configuration switch.
- Useful for **testing and learning** about SSL, proxy authentication, and basic socket communication.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python (or C/C++ based on your actual implementation)
- SSL (via OpenSSL or built-in library)
- TCP Sockets
